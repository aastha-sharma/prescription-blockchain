# Blockchain Electronic Medication History (EMH-BC)

## Overview
A patient-centric, blockchain-powered solution for comprehensive and secure medication history management, designed to reduce medication discrepancies and improve patient safety.

## Problem Statement
Medication history errors are prevalent in healthcare:
- Up to 70% of hospital admissions involve medication discrepancies
- Existing electronic health records operate in isolated silos
- Current medication reconciliation processes are error-prone

## Key Innovations
### Patient-Centered Approach
- Patients become primary stewards of their medication history
- Create a single, trusted source of truth for medication information

### Advanced Reconciliation Features
- Comprehensive tracking of medication changes
- Support for multiple prescribers and pharmacies
- Intelligent error detection and prevention

## Technical Architecture
### Core Components
- **Blockchain Network**: Hyperledger Fabric
- **Smart Contracts**: Go-based chaincode
- **Storage**: 
  - On-chain: CouchDB
  - Off-chain: IPFS
- **API Gateway**: Node.js Express
- **User Interface**: React.js

## Key Capabilities
1. **Medication History Management**
   - Comprehensive medication tracking
   - Transition of care support
   - Multi-provider coordination

2. **Safety Mechanisms**
   - Look-alike/sound-alike medication warnings
   - Elderly patient medication complexity handling
   - Cultural and language sensitivity

3. **Compliance and Security**
   - HIPAA compliance
   - Advanced data protection
   - Cryptographically secure transaction logging

## Outcome Measures
1. Reduction in Adverse Drug Events (ADEs)
2. Improved Medication Compliance
3. Enhanced Patient Satisfaction
4. Robust System Security

## Technology Stack
- **Blockchain**: Hyperledger Fabric
- **Chaincode**: Go
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Database**: CouchDB
- **File Storage**: IPFS

## Unique Value Proposition
- Transforms medication history from a fragmented process to a secure, transparent ecosystem
- Empowers patients with complete medication information
- Reduces healthcare providers' administrative burden
- Minimizes medication-related errors
